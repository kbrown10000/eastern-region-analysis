# Eastern Region Margin Analysis
## Blended GP: 43.1% — 9 Points Above West (34.3%)

### Executive Summary
The Eastern region delivers **significantly higher margins** than the West, driven by a managed services model in Genetown (Boston) accounts. However, one major account — Takeda at 14.5% GP — drags the blended margin down from what could be 50%+.

## The Problem Accounts

| Customer | Revenue | GP% | Territory | Issue |
|----------|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Takeda Pharmaceuticals | $702K | 14.5% | Genetown | T&M staffing model |
| Spectranetics | $242K | 26.4% | Mid-Atlantic | Declining -51% YoY |
| Formation Bio | $30K | 27.9% | Genetown | Low margin, small |
| Bausch Health | $739K | 29.4% | NJ Pharma | Needs margin lift |
| **TOTAL** | **$1.71M** | **~24%** | | |

### Impact Calculation
- These 4 accounts represent ~31% of East revenue
- At 24% GP vs. regional target of 50%+ = **$445K in missing margin**
- Takeda alone accounts for $179K of the gap

---

## Why These Accounts Are Low Margin

### 1. Takeda — T&M Staffing Model
- Largest Genetown account at $702K but only 14.5% GP
- Pure time-based billing, no managed services component
- Growing fast (+88% YoY) which amplifies the margin drag
- Fix: Convert to managed services → target 40% GP = +$179K profit

### 2. Bausch Health — Mixed Model
- Largest NJ account at $739K at 29.4% GP
- Partially staffing CBA, partially consulting
- Fix: Shift mix toward managed services → target 40% GP = +$78K

### 3. Spectranetics — Declining & Low Margin
- Revenue halved from $496K to $242K at 26.4% GP
- Risk of further erosion or churn
- Fix: Save review + margin improvement or managed exit
